                        p During the Spring 2014 semester, I began taking 16-815 (Advanced Mobile Robot Development), putting my skills toward the CMU 
                            a(href="http://www.cmu.edu/google-lunar-x/") LunarX initiative
                            | .  Our goal is to improve on the "Andy" rover built by previous semesters in order to create a moon-ready rover by the beginning of May 2014.  I am on the Avionics team, which is in charge of on-board electronics hardware and software.  My primary contribution is to the firmware subteam, where I've been writing C using 
                            a(href="http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/") AVR Libc 
                            |  to write the firmware for the custom boards designed by my colleagues.  The project is being led by Dr. Red Whittaker of the CMU Robotics Institute.

                            a(href="http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.html") Biorobotics Lab
                            | .  There, I have worked with firmware, communications, module repair, and project management
                            | software for the lab.  The Biorobotics lab's largest project is the 
                            a(href="http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/projects/modsnake") ModSnake project
                            | , which concerns itself with building modular snake robots for search and rescue, among other
                            | purposes.
                        p This spring, I began working on the lab's newest endeavor, known for now as "CappoBot".  The first goal of the project is to create a self-stabilizing car that uses a gyroscope and the moment of inertia of it's wheels to stabilize in the air.  I learned to use Solidworks to design the layout of the first version of the robot.  I also learned to use a 3D printer to print some components.
