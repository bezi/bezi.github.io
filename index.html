Our goal is to improve on the "Andy" rover built by previous semesters in order to create a moon-ready rover by the beginning of May 2014.  I am on the Avionics team, which is in charge of on-board electronics hardware and software.  My primary contribution is to the firmware subteam, where I've been writing C using <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/">AVR Libc </a> to write the firmware for the custom boards designed by my colleagues.  The project is being led by Dr. Red Whittaker of the CMU Robotics Institute.</p></li><li><h3 id="modsnake">CMU Biorobotics Lab</h3><p>Starting during the fall of 2013, I began working for Dr. Howie Choset 
and the rest of the team at CMU's <a href="http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.html">Biorobotics Lab</a>.  There, I have worked with firmware, communications, module repair, and project management
software for the lab.  The Biorobotics lab's largest project is the <a href="http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/projects/modsnake">ModSnake project</a>, which concerns itself with building modular snake robots for search and rescue, among other
purposes.</p><p>This spring, I began working on the lab's newest endeavor, known for now as "CappoBot".  The first goal of the project is to create a self-stabilizing car that uses a gyroscope and the moment of inertia of it's wheels to stabilize in the air.  I learned to use Solidworks to design the layout of the first version of the robot.  I also learned to use a 3D printer to print some components. </p></li></ul></div><div id="hackathons" class="info-section"><h2>Hackathons</h2><ul class="info-section-content"><li><h3 id="hackprinceton_2013">HackPrinceton 2013</h3><p>On November 8-10, 2013, I traveled to Princeton.  My teammates, Sinan Cepel, <a href="http://jacobzimmerman.me">Jake Zimmerman</a> and Andre Jia, got their first taste of the hackathon experience, while I had never competed in a 48-hour event.
We were really interested in the data APIs we were shown by the sponsors, including the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">Yahoo Query Language</a>, or YQL.  We created <a href="#globalizr">Globalizr</a> in  <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django </a> to take advantage of this information and display it in an new way using <a href="http://www.khronos.org/webgl/">WebGL</a>.</p></li><li> <h3 id="hackcmu_2013">HackCMU 2013</h3><p>On September 14-15, 2013, I worked with <a href="http://justingallag.com/">Justin Gallagher </a> and Kirn Hans to make <a href="#cmueats">CMUEats</a>, a website to help keep track of CMU's eating options.  It was my first hackathon, and I learned
a lot!  We built CMUEats in <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django </a>and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, although Justin and I would later port it to <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>.</p></li></ul></div><div id="apps" class="info-section"><h2>Web Apps</h2><ul class="info-section-content"><li><h3 id="angstlist">Angstlist</h3><p> <a href="http://angstlist-dev.herokuapp.com">Angstlist</a> is the development name for a tradepost I'm writing for my bestest pals
in CFA, specifically the visual artists.  The front-end is being written in <a href="">Jade</a> and <a href="">Sass</a>, while the backend has been built with <a href="">Node.js </a>and <a href="">MongoDB</a>.  It's my project for Winter Break 2013 (among other things, which are under
wraps for now).  I'd also never used MongoDB, so it's a learning experience.
The current name is a play on words on Craigslist, and I really
hope I can keep it.  Guess it depends on the artists' sense of humor!</p></li><li><h3 id="cmueats">CMUEats!</h3><p> <a href="http://cmueats.com">CMUEats</a>, developed with Kirn Hans and <a href="http://justingallag.com/">Justin Gallagher</a> at <a href="#hackcmu2013">HackCMU 2013</a>, is a site that allows people to easily check what food places are open around CMU, and when.
Originally written in <a href="">Django</a>, Justin and I chose to port it to <a href="">Node.js</a> over Winter Break 2013.  As of now, the front end is powered by <a href="">Jade</a> and <a href="">Bootstrap</a>.  As my first web app, I'm extremely pleased to get moderate traffic even several months after
the hackathon.  Justin and I are continuing to add to CMUEats! as we find necessary or useful.</p></li><li><h3 id="globalizr">Globalizr</h3><p>In the fall of 2013, I was in a four person team that built <a href="http://globalizr.org">Globalizr</a> at <a href="#hackprinceton2013">HackPrinceton 2013</a>.  We chose to work with <a href="">Django</a> to build a system to display global information we'd found in the <a href="">YQL</a> database.  The entire system is written in Python.</p></li></ul></div><div id="interests" class="info-section"><h2>Other Interests</h2><p class="info-section-content">I am a member of CMU's <a href="">rowing crew</a>, which has been a wonderful experience.
