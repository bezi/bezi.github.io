<h1>The Mass and Spring Model of the Atomic Lattice</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The project set out to implement the mass and spring model of the atomic lattice in VPython.  The goal of the model was to be able to use numerical integration to find the speed of sound through an object.  While the model was successfully implemented, it was found that it was inadequate for analysis due to runtime concerns and the nature of model.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of the project was to find out if the spring-lattice model of interatomic forces was appropriate for a numerical  integration. Aluminum and lead were chosen as two candidate elements (due to their lattice structure, and since they are solid at room temperature).   Values were calculated for several constants in the model including the number of atoms per surface, the interatomic distance, the interatomic spring constant, the effective spring constant, and the speed of sound. These values were calculated from theoretical values in the textbook for the molar mass, the density, and the Young's modulus.  </p>
<p>Several simplifying assumptions were made. The solid would be a rectangular prism with two square faces.  The atoms were assumed to collide elastically.  Finally, as part of the model, only the forces from adjacent atoms were considered.   Calculated constants along with theoretical constants were used in the VPython model.</p>
<h2>Mass and Spring Model</h2>
<p>The mass and spring model of an atom simplifies the forces that maintain the shape of a solid object.  The electrostatic, gravitational, and other forces can be modeled to a good degree of accuracy by a spring force.  The object consists of a uniform lattice of atoms with a separation <em>d</em>, each connected to their adjacent atoms with a spring with spring constant <em>k</em>.  These values can be calculated from fundamental constants.  When a force is applied to one edge of the structure, rather than moving rigidly, the force propagates through the solid, at the speed of sound (through that object).</p>
<h2>Calculated Values and Constants</h2>
<img id=values src="values.png" />
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The program was implemented in two main files, <code>model.py</code> and <code>main.py</code>.  <code>model.py</code> contained the class definitions for the model.  Of main interest are the <code>Solid</code>, <code>AtomLayer</code>, and <code>Atom</code> classes.  A <code>Solid</code> is made up of an array of <code>AtomLayer</code>s.  Furthermore, each <code>AtomLayer</code> is an array of <code>Atoms</code> that form a square plane.  The spring force is calculated once between every layer (as the layers are uniformly far apart).  Then, it is applied to all the atoms in the layer at once.  This keeps the calculations down to <code>O(n)</code> rather than <code>O(n^3)</code> for an <code>n x n x n</code> cube.  Force is applied to the system by applying it the <code>front</code> face of the cube, then updating the solid.  </p>
<p>In <code>main.py</code>, a solid is defined with the correct parameters, and the event loop is defined.  A (possibly variable) force is applied over some time <em>t</em>, and every cycle the model is updated.  Graph information was also defined in <code>main.py</code>.</p>
<p>We seeked to find the speed of sound through an object.  Our method for doing so was to apply a force to one face of the solid, pushing it in a distance <em>d</em>. Then the frames until the opposite face was displaced by <em>d</em> could be counted, giving the speed of sound (the time for the compression wave to pass through the structure).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It was concluded that the model is not appropriate for numerical analysis.  The small mass of a single atom makes the speed of sound calculation far too complex for solids with non-trivial masses (a 0.01 gram object was far beyond the capabilities of a 3.2GHz processor).  However, even with small masses, there was excessive error.  Since the calculation is discrete, there is always a slight error.  However, the large number of springs compounded the individual overshoots, which were magnified by the large spring constants (small errors in the position caused much larger changes in the resulting spring force).  The final measurement varied wildly with small changes to either the force or <em>dt</em>, the discrete time unit per frame.   Making the <em>dt</em> small enough to get reliable results causes the program to take far too long to run.</p>
